Gene Expression View
====================

The Gene Expression View allows you to view 
 (1) gene expression in `1234 libraries <https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net/tools/exp-view/meta_samples.php>`__ and 9 different tissues under pan-genome context covering 3 distinct developmental stages during its life cycle, including callus, cotyledon, root, stem peel, leaf, bud, flower, silique, silique wall and seed. Especially, there exist 26 and 23 time points in seed and silique wall respectively and 24 leaf developmental time points, with 2 day intervals. 
 (2) view population gene expression of B. napus 219 germplasms in shoot apical meristem (SAM) and silique tissues.
