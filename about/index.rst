About BnaOmics
==============

`BnaOmics <https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net//>`__ is a comprehensive and
multi-omics database for rapeseed genetics discovery and crop
improvement. It integrates omics data generated from 381 germplasms
(from association mapping population) and 2504 germplasms downloaded
from public database (NCBI and NGDC). BnaOmics includes:

-  different versions of genome assemblies and annotations of 18
   germplasms (total of 26 genomes), including Darmor, Express617,
   Gangan, J9707_zhou, Kale, Laurentian, Mendel, NY7, No2127, Quinta,
   Shengli, Tapidor, Westar, ZS11, ZS4-2, ZS9, ZY821, Zheyou7. For the
   details of source reference of each genome, users can refer to
   `here <https://bnaomics.ocri-genomics.net//tools/jb>`__.

-  genetic variations including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
   small insertions and deletions (InDels) and large structure
   variations (SVs) generated from 381 high-depth and 2504 low-depth
   sequencing germplasms.

-  expression values of different tissues in same germplasm and same
   tissue of different samples.

-  the phenotypes and values.

-  the epigenome information, including HiC and DNA methylation data.

BnaOmics generated comprehensive functional annotations for each gene
model in each genome assembly, and also provide useful tools for users
to search, analyze and visualize all these data.
