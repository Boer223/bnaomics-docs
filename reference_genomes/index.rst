Reference Genomes Overview Page
=============================

All the available data for each reference genome is easily found through
their Overview page. From the BnaOmics homepage, these are accessed
either by selecting them in the Major Varieties menu in the toolbar.

On each Reference Genomes Overview page, there are two main sections. The
left side toolbar is static and has a Data section and a Tools section.
The links in these sections either change the information to the right
of the toolbar, or open another tab with the linked information. Major
Varieties Overview pages default to the Overview section which contains
basic information and a summary of related BnaOmics data.
